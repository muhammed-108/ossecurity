1.3.1 Configuring a Warning for Remote Network Access
The warning is used to warn users before logging in to a system, telling that they may be
punished for illegal intrusion to deter potential attackers. In addition, this can also hide
system architecture and information to prevent targeted attacks on the system.
You can modify the /etc/issue.net file to implement this setting. Replace the original
content of the /etc/issue.net file with the following information (which has been set in
openEuler by default):
Authorized users only. All activities may be monitored and reported.
1.3.2 Disabling System Restart Using Ctrl+Alt+Del
By default, the OS can be restarted by pressing "Ctrl+Alt+Del". You are advised to disable
this function to prevent data loss caused by misoperations.
To disable this function, perform the following steps:
Step 1 Delete the two ctrl-alt-del.target files.

[root@Jumpserver ~]# rm -f /etc/systemd/system/ctrl-alt-del.target
[root@Jumpserver ~]# rm -f /usr/lib/systemd/system/ctrl-alt-del.target
Step 2 Modify the /etc/systemd/system.conf file.
Change #CtrlAltDelBurstAction=reboot-force to CtrlAltDelBurstAction=none.
Step 3 Restart systemd for the modification to take effect.
[root@Jumpserver ~]# systemctl daemon-reexec


1.3.3 Setting the Automatic Timeout for Terminals
Unattended devices are prone to listening or attacks. Therefore, you are advised to set
terminals to automatically exit after they stop running for a period of time.
At the end of the /etc/profile file, set the TMOUT field (unit: second) that specifies the
interval for automatic exit as follows:
export TMOUT=300



1.3.4 Setting the Default User's umask Value to 0077
The umask value is used to set the default permission on a newly created file or
directory. If the umask value is too small, the permission of group users or other users is
too high, which threatens system security. Therefore, the default umask value for all
users is set to 0077. That is, the default permission on directories created by users is 700,
and the default permission on files is 600.
By default, the default user's umask value in openEuler is 0022.
Step 1 Add umask 0077 to the /etc/bashrc file and all files in /etc/profile.d/.
[root@Jumpserver ~]# echo "umask 0077" >> /etc/bashrc
[root@Jumpserver ~]# for i in `ls /etc/profile.d`;do echo "umask 0077" >> $i;done
Step 2 Set the owner and group of the /etc/bashrc file and all files in /etc/profile.d/ to
root.
$FILE indicates the file name, for example, /etc/bashrc.


1.3.5 Setting the Encryption Password of GRUB2
The default password of GRUB2 is openEuler#12. You are advised to change the default
password upon the first login and periodically update the password. If the password is
leaked, startup item configurations may be modified, causing the system startup failure.
Step 1 Use the grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 command to generate an encrypted password.
[root@Jumpserver ~]# grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2
Enter password: 
Reenter password:
PBKDF2 hash of your password is
grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.011476329D0DCD1DE1758B7F19BC275BB60CC6C3DF1082BFB812D249112
484E7E7C084E6687A957BB91B40F0A8860E78872AACB89F277EB7D68DC2BD86D34E13.B29208FBE27
1A702ECA14CCB518C165F86564EED56D277434A289948C2504C5AAB73DFCF8E87B160525953DFC51
A57B3A17CE4452E2DD6BB0FAC1A0F36120FB4

Step 2 Add the following fields to the /etc/grub2.cfg file:
[root@Jumpserver ~]# vi /etc/grub2.cfg
set superusers="root"
password_pbkdf2 root
grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.011476329D0DCD1DE1758B7F19BC275BB60CC6C3DF1082BFB812D249112
484E7E7C084E6687A957BB91B40F0A8860E78872AACB89F277EB7D68DC2BD86D34E13.B29208FBE27
1A702ECA14CCB518C165F86564EED56D277434A289948C2504C5AAB73DFCF8E87B160525953DFC51
A57B3A17CE4452E2DD6BB0FAC1A0F36120FB4
The superusers field is used to set the account name of the super GRUB2 administrator.
The first parameter following the password_pbkdf2 field is the GRUB2 account name,
and the second parameter is the encrypted password of the account.
1.3.6 Resetting the Root Password
Step 1 Restart the system and go to the GRUB screen.
Restart the openEuler system. When the GUN GRUB screen is displayed, press e to modify
the startup command of the system.
Enter the user name root and the encrypted GRUB2 password to go to the startup
command modification screen.

Step 2 Add the rd.break parameter to enter the single-user mode.
Find the line starting with "linux" and add rd.break to the end of the line.
Press CTRL+x to enable the single-user mode.

Step 3 Remount the root directory.
Remount the root directory (/sysroot) in writable mode and switch to this environment.
sh-5.1# mount -o remount, rw /sysroot
sh-5.1# chroot /sysroot
Step 4 Reset the password of the root user.
sh-5.1# echo "Huawei@123" | passwd --stdin root
sh-5.1# exit
sh-5.1# reboot
