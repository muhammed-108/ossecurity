1.1.1 About This Lab
This lab describes hardening policies of the openEuler OS from five aspects to improve
system and networking security.
1.1.2 Objectives
⚫ Master hardening policies for system services.
⚫ Master hardening policies for kernel parameters.
⚫ Master hardening policies for accounts and passwords.
⚫ Master hardening policies for authorization and authentication.
⚫ Master hardening policies for file permissions.


1.1.3 Planning
In this lab, the JumpServer cloud host is used as the only entry to the intranet, and
security hardening is performed on the host.



The kernel provides a configurable system control function, which can improve the OS
security by controlling various configurable kernel parameters.
⚫ All hardening items are written in the /etc/sysctl.conf file.
⚫ Load the sysctl.conf file for the configured kernel parameters to take effect.
[root@Jumpserver ~]# sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf
1.2.1 Hardening Policy Configuration
Step 1 ip_forward: enables IP routing to facilitate data packet forwarding.
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
Step 2 log_martians: records data packets with abnormal IP addresses in logs.
net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians=1

Step 3 send_redirects: disables all interfaces from sending IPv4 ICMP redirection packets.
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects=0
Step 4 accept_source_route: disables source routing data packets.
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route=0
Step 5 accept_redirects: disables the function of accepting ICMP redirection packets.
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects=0
Step 6 icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts: disables response to the ping broadcast.
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts=1
Step 7 rp_filter: disables triangular routing and responds to queries from the same API.
This prevents IP spoofing.
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=1
Step 8 tcp_syncookies: enables SYN flooding protection to prevent DoS attacks.
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1
