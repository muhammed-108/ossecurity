The SSH protocol can effectively prevent information leakage during remote
management.
⚫ All hardening items of the SSH service are stored in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.
⚫ The configuration that has been commented out in the file is the default openEuler
policy.
⚫ After the configuration is modified, restart the SSH service for the modification to
take effect.
[root@Jumpserver ~]# systemctl restart sshd


1.6.1 Limiting the Number of Identity Authentication Attempts
It is a good way to mitigate brute force attacks by limiting the maximum number of
authentication failures.
code : 
MaxAuthTries 3
If a user fails to enter the correct password for three consecutive times when logging in
to the OS, the user will be locked for 60 seconds. 

1.6.2 Forbidding Login Using Accounts with Empty Passwords
Any SSH connection requires a non-null password string.
PermitEmptyPasswords no
1.6.3 Disabling Password-Free Login Based on Trusted Hosts
The rhosts file is a method of controlling the trust relationship between systems. If a
system trusts another system, the system allows login from the trusted system without a
password.
This file is seldom used. It is recommended that you disable it in most cases.
IgnoreRhosts yes
1.6.4 Displaying the Date and Time of the Last Login
By printing the date and time of the last login, users can be aware of unauthorized
account login events, which will facilitate investigation of unidentified accesses.
PrintLastLog yes
The last login time of the user is displayed as follows.

1.6.5 Terminating Idle SSH Sessions
Keeping SSH sessions active for a long time may cause security risks. It is recommended
that idle SSH sessions be terminated.
ClientAliveInterval 900
ClientAliveCountMax 0
Inactive sessions are automatically disconnected after 15 minutes (900 seconds).


1.6.6 Listening to a Specific Address
By default, SSH listens to all IP addresses configured on the local host, but you should
bind SSH to a specific IP address.
ListenAddress 192.168.0.48
1.6.7 Configuring the SSH Blocklist
Users in the DenyUsers list are not allowed to log in.
DenyUsers $username
By default, users not listed in the blocklist are considered trustlist users. Blocklist and
trustlist users cannot exist at the same time.
1.6.8 Disabling Login of the Root User
Forcing users to remotely log in to the system using specific accounts ensures
accountability.
PermitRootLogin no
The root user is not allowed to remotely log in to the system, and a common user is not
allowed to switch to the root user.

1.6.9 Allowing Login Through Key Authentication
Key authentication remembers passwords and allows for password-free authentication.
PubkeyAuthentication yes

Step 1 Generate a local key.
ssh-keygen

Step 2 View the key and modify the permission.
[root@Jumpserver ~]# ls .ssh/
id_rsa id_rsa.pub known_hosts known_hosts.old
[root@Jumpserver ~]# chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
[root@Jumpserver ~]# chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
[root@Jumpserver ~]# chmod 700 ~/.ssh
Step 3 Upload the public key to the server.
[root@Jumpserver ~]# cd .ssh/
[root@Jumpserver .ssh]# ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub root@192.168.0.49
Step 4 View the public key and verify the result.
[root@Server ~]# ls -l .ssh/
total 12
-rw------- 1 root root 569 May 15 06:45 authorized_keys
-rw------- 1 root root 834 May 15 03:07 known_hosts
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 94 May 15 03:06 known_hosts.old


1.6.10 Disabling Password Authentication Login
After a public key is used for login authentication, do not use a password to log in to the
system to prevent password leakage. This policy applies only to the intranet web server.
PasswordAuthentication no

1.7 Quiz
⚫ Can a common user switch to the root user after the root user is forbidden from
remote login during SSHD service hardening?
Answer: Yes.
