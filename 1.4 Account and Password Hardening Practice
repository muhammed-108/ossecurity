1.4 Account and Password Hardening Practice
1.4.1 Shielding System Accounts
Accounts are classified into user accounts and system accounts. System accounts can only
be used inside a system and cannot be used to log in to the system or perform other
operations. Therefore, system accounts are shielded.
Change shell of a system account to /sbin/nologin. systemaccount indicates a system
account.
usermod -L -s /sbin/nologin systemaccount
Find out the accounts that are forbidden from logging in to the system and check the
account status.
[root@Jumpserver ~]# cat /etc/passwd | grep nologin
bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin
daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin
adm:x:3:4:adm:/var/adm:/sbin/nologin
dhcpd:x:177:177:DHCP server:/:/sbin/nologin
[root@Jumpserver ~]# passwd -S dhcpd
dhcpd LK 2022-03-30 -1 -1 -1 -1 (Password locked.)

1.4.2 Restricting Accounts that Are Allowed to Use su Commands
su commands are used to switch between accounts. To enhance system security, it is
necessary to control the permissions to use su commands. Only the root user and those
in the wheel group are allowed to use su commands.
You can modify the /etc/pam.d/su file to control the use of su commands as follows:
auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid
1.4.3 Hardening su Commands
To enhance system security and prevent environment variables of the current user from
being brought into other environments when you run su commands to switch to another
user, this configuration has been made in openEuler by default. PATH is always initialized
when su commands are used to switch users.
Implement this setting in the /etc/login.defs file as follows:
ALWAYS_SET_PATH=yes
1.4.4 Setting a Password Validity Period
To ensure system security, you are advised to set a password validity period and notify
users of changing passwords before the passwords expire.
You can set a password validity period by modifying the hardening-related field in the
/etc/login.defs file.
PASS_MAX_DAYS 90
PASS_MIN_DAYS 0
PASS_MIN_LEN 5
PASS_WARN_AGE 7


1.4.5 Setting Password Complexity
You can set password complexity by modifying the corresponding configuration file as
required.
Add the following content to the first two lines of the password configuration item in the
/etc/pam.d/password-auth and /etc/pam.d/system-auth files:
password requisite pam_pwquality.so minlen=8 minclass=3 enforce_for_root try_first_pass
local_users_only retry=3 dcredit=0 ucredit=0 lcredit=0 ocredit=0
password required pam_pwhistory.so use_authtok remember=5 enforce_for_root


1.4.6 Setting Password Encryption Algorithms
For system security, passwords cannot be stored in plaintext in the system and must be
encrypted. Irreversible cryptographic algorithms must be used in scenarios where
passwords do not need to be recovered.
Set the password encryption algorithm to sha512, which has been set by default in
openEuler. These settings can effectively prevent password disclosure and keep
passwords secure.
Modify the /etc/pam.d/password-auth and /etc/pam.d/system-auth files.
password sufficient pam_unix.so sha512 shadow nullok try_first_pass use_authtok


1.4.7 Locking an Account After Three Login Failures
To ensure system security, you are advised to set the maximum number of incorrect
password attempts (three times recommended) and the automatic unlocking time (300
seconds recommended) for a locked account.
During the locking period, any input is considered invalid, but will not cause the locking
timer to re-count. Records of users' incorrect attempts are cleared once the account is
unlocked. The preceding settings protect passwords from being forcibly cracked and
improve system security.
You can set password complexity by modifying the /etc/pam.d/password-auth and
/etc/pam.d/system-auth files. In the following example, the maximum number of
incorrect password attempts is set to 3 and the unlocking time after an account is locked
is set to 300 seconds.
auth required pam_faillock.so preauth audit deny=3 even_deny_root unlock_time=300
auth [default=die] pam_faillock.so authfail audit deny=3 even_deny_root unlock_time=300
auth sufficient pam_faillock.so authsucc audit deny=3 even_deny_root unlock_time=300
